## Quadtree collision detection implementation using haxe.

A quadtree can be used to minimize the amount of collision checks needed for collision detection.


I'm using [Kha](https://github.com/Kode/Kha) to visualize the collisions but the classes can easily be adapted for use with a different framework.
You can see the quadtree in action [here](https://codescapade.github.io/quadtree-collision/).
