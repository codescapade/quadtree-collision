				<ul>
					<li>Hold the mouse button down in the world to create boxes.</li>
					<li>Press <b>G</b> to show/hide the grid.</li>
					<li>Press <b>R</b> to reset the world.</li>
					<li>Press <b>P</b> to toggle pause.</li>
					<li>When paused you can click on a box to highlight the boxes that will be checked for collision with that box.</li>
				</ul>
				The boxes are red when they collide with each other and green if selected.

				This is my implementation of a quadtree for collision detection. It is written in
				 <a href="https://www.haxe.org" target="_blank">Haxe</a> and uses <a href="https://github.com/Kode/Kha" target="_blank">Kha</a> to visualize it.
				When you use a quadtree it can drastically improve the amount of checks you have to do to check all boxes for a collision as you see can above.
				 The quadtree divides the world into a grid and with the grid it can retrieve which boxes are close to each other.
				 That way you only have to loop over a few neighboring boxes to check for collisions instead of all of them.<br/>
